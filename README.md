# BabySteps-MyFirstPrograms
This program is a simple emulator of how a coffee vending machine might work. it asks for you to write which action you want to take, to make coffee? 
fill the machine with materials? Take money out of the machine? or to exit the program. it will keep asking until you exit. when you make coffee it will update the inventory,
and when it runs low on a supply it will stop making coffee and put out an error message.
