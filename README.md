# BabySteps-MyFirstPrograms

HOW TO RUN: The source code is a single class java file, it can be saved as a text file, then in your console navigate to the directory you saved it in, and compile via the command 'javac CoffeeMachine.java' and then run via 'java CoffeeMachine.java' and it will run in the console. 

Make sure to name the file "CoffeeMachine.java"
Make sure you have java installed on your machine or code will not compile.

This program is a simple emulator of how a coffee vending machine might work. it asks for you to write which action you want to take:
to make coffee? 
fill the machine with materials? 
Take money out of the machine? or to exit the program. 

it will keep asking until you exit. when you make coffee it will update the inventory,
and when it runs low on a supply it will stop making coffee and put out an error message.
